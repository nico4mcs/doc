# Power

In this Chapter we will take a look at the differences of AC and DC.

## DC Direct Current

DC power is constant. That means, that the direction always stays the
same. DC is needed e.g. for batteries, which includes all devices with a
battery pack, or TVs

## AC Alternate current

AC power has an amount of Hz e.g. in Switzerland it has 50Hz, which
means it changes the direction 100 times a second. AC is needed for
everything with a motor, like a mixer. But also, a stove needs AC power.

### Frequencies

Like said before in Switzerland uses A Frequency of 50 Hz. Some
Countries e.g. the USA use 60Hz.

A complete List of the different frequencies can be found here:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country#Table_of_mains_voltages,_frequencies,_and_plugs>

But what happens if you plug a 50Hz device in a 60Hz plug?

If it is a DC device it will convert the power and it does not affect
the function of the device. But if it is an AC Device it will run
faster. This doesn't have to do anything, but it can overheat and break.

#### Nettime

The nettime is the time measured by the Frequency of the power. E.g.
ovens use it in the built in clock. If the frequency is less than 50 Hz,
the nettime is too slow. If it's more, the nettime is too fast.
