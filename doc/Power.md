# Power

In this Chapter, we will take a look at the differences between AC and DC.

## DC Direct Current

DC power is constant. That means, that the direction always stays the same. DC is needed e.g. for batteries, which includes all devices with a battery pack, or TVs

## AC Alternate Current

AC power has an amount of Hz e.g. in Switzerland it has 50Hz, which means it changes the direction 100 times a second. AC is needed for everything with a motor, like a mixer. But also, a stove needs AC power.

### Frequencies

As said before Switzerland uses A Frequency of 50 Hz. Some
Countries e.g. the USA use 60Hz.

A complete List of the different frequencies can be found here:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country#Table_of_mains_voltages,_frequencies,_and_plugs>

But what happens if you plug a 50Hz device into a 60Hz plug?

If it is a DC device it will convert the power and it does not affect
the function of the device. But if it is an AC Device it will run slightly faster. This doesn't have to do anything, but it can overheat and break.

#### Nettime

The net time is the time measured by the frequency of the AC power. E.g. ovens use it in the built-in clock. If the frequency is less than 50 Hz, the net time is too slow. If it's more, the net time is too fast. The power distributors constantly try to keep the net time as close as possible to the actual time.
