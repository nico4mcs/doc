# Differences between JavaScript and c# #
## Types
One of the biggest differences between JavaScript and c# is, that c# is strongly typed. That means every object must have a Type which has to be clear before running the program. 
## .net
C# is a .net language, which means, that you can run it wherever .net runs. 
## Classes
In JavaScript, you can write classes, but best-practice is to write the code imperatively. C# is completely object-oriented.
