# Differences between JavaScript and C# #

## Types

One of the biggest differences between JavaScript and C# is, that C# is strongly typed. That means every object must have a type which has to be declared before running the program. 

## .NET

C# is a .NET language, which means, that you can run it wherever .NET runs. 

## Classes

In JavaScript, you can write classes, but best-practice is to write the code imperatively. C# is completely object-oriented.

## HTML

JavaScript can be used with HTML without any additional software or framework. In C# you need to use ASP.NET.
